<!--
| ANGULAR:
  Angular thinks in components.
  Angular is a browser tye framework.

  |-- Index.html
  |-- <app-root> -> Loaded in index.html file - selector.
  |-- Script imports -> Injected.
  |-- Module.ts -> Defines feature & building block of application.
    |-- Application can be split into modules.
    |-- Declaration -> Registering component with angular - making angular aware of component.
    |-- Bootstrap -> Root component.
      |-- All other components are nested inside the root component.
    |-- import -> Imports modules need for application.
  |-- Main.ts -> Starts the Angular application - code in here executes first.
  |-- Component -> Create a component by creating a new class.
    |-- Class -> [Typescript & latest Javascript features] - allows for creation of object blueprint.
    |-- Decorator -> Turn class into a component angular understands by adding a decorator - @Component()
  |-- Typescript ->
  |-- Outputting content:
    |-- STRING INTERPOLATION -> [ {{ property name }} ]
    |-- PROPERTY BINDING -> [ [property name] ]
    |-- LOCAL REFERENCE -> [ #property name ]
    |-- TWO-WAY BINDING -> [ [(Directive)]="method()" ]
  |-- [ (postCreated)="onPostAdded($event)" ]:
    |-- (POSTCREATED) -> event binding -> listening to (postCreated) event.
    |-- "ONPOSTADEED()" -> We're adding the post to storedPosts list.
    |-- $EVENT -> Give access to data we emit.
    |-- [POSTS]="STOREDPOSTS" -> passing down storedpost list to app-post-list.
  |-- MODELS -> Blueprints defining how a content appears.
    |-- INTERFACE -> Simialar to Class -> Defines how an Object appears -> But can't be instantiated.
